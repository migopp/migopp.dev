## Howdy, I'm Michael! ðŸ‘‹

I study CS & Math @ [UT Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/), and I'm interested in systems programming.
More specifically, OS development and security.
I love to tinker, so I'm usually reverse-engineering to implementing something to figure out how it works.

I rebuilt this website fairly recently to make adding to it more ergonomic to extend.
I've seen this general trend towards markdown as a viable web markup langauge, and I use it quite often,
so I figured I'd give it a go.
To be honest, I also just wanted an excuse to look more into C-oriented custom build systems.
If you're interested, take a look at the [source](/) for this site.
